Simple Areas

To increase our storage capacity we should start with calculating the area of the rooms we have available.

You should write a function to calculate the area of simple figures: circles, rectangles and triangles. 
You are given an arbitrary number of arguments which the function should use to calculate the area for the different figures.

    One argument -- The diameter of a circle and you need calculate the area of the circle.
    Two arguments -- The side lengths of a rectangle and you need calculate the area of the rectangle.
    Three arguments -- The lengths of each side on a triangle and you need calculate the area of the triangle.

The result should be given with two digit precision like so: +-0.01

Input: One, two or three arguments as floats or as integers.

Output: The area of the circle, the rectangle or the triangle
